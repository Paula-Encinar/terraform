## Terraform Cloud
Terraform Cloud builds on these features by managing Terraform runs in a consistent and reliable environment instead of on your local machine. It securely stores state and secret data, and can connect to version control systems so that you can develop your infrastructure using a workflow similar to application development. The Terraform Cloud UI provides a detailed view into the resources managed by a Terraform project and gives enhanced visibility into each Terraform operation.

Terraform Cloud also has a private registry for sharing your organization's Terraform modules and providers.
